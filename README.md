Evolving Continuous Cellular Automata for Aesthetic Objectives
Jeff Heaton

**Abstract;** Presented is a genetic algorithm (GA) capable of evolving con- tinuous cellular automata (CA) that generate full color dynamic animations according to aesthetic user specifications. Previous human-guided generative art, created by GAs, focused primarily upon the generation of static images and 3D forms that are produced from complex systems, such as neural net- works. These techniques often required iteration-level human guidance. We present MergeLife, a simple 16-byte update rule and objective function that require only initial human aesthetic guidelines. The 16-byte update rule pro- vides a relatively convex search space, as small changes to a single byte produce correspondingly small changes in the resulting animation.

The results of this research are several complex and long running up- date rules and the objective function parameters that produced them. Several update rules produced from this paper exhibit complex emergent behavior through patterns, such as spaceships, guns, oscillators, and Universal Turing Machines. Because the true animated behavior of these CA cannot be observed from static images, we also present an on-line JavaScript viewer that is capable of displaying any MergeLife 16-byte update rule.
