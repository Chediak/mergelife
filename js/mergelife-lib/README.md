MergeLife JavaScript Library
============================

This project builds the two minified library files needed by MergeLife:

* **mergelife-evolve** - Used to evolve new MergeLife rules.
* **mergelife** - Used to render MergeLife grids.

These libraries are build with the following command:

These two libraries can be used both from NodeJS and browers based applications.
